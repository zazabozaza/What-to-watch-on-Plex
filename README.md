Value: A comma-separated list of the allowed origins, e.g.: 
http://192.168.1.100:PORT,https://wtw.yourdomain.com

---

## Configuration
### Plex Connection

1. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`. (or whichever port you mapped)
2. Open the Admin Panel and set your Admin password.
3. Enter your Plex `http://IP:PORT` and [Plex Token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)
4. Select your libraries ==> click on `Save Settings` ==> click on `Refresh Cache` and wait for the cache to be completed.

### Allowed Domains
If you access this app through a custom domain or reverse proxy (e.g. wtw.mydomain.com), add it here.
Only requests from allowed domains will be accepted.

### Optional Settings

- **Auto Refresh:** Automatically refresh your cache at 3AM.
- **Custom Logo:** Upload your custom logo to be used on the landing page.
- **Selection Limits:** Choose how many `Preferences` and `Exclusions` users can set.
> [!NOTE]
> `Preferences` are seen just that. If user1 sets preference for `comedy` and user2 sets preference for `action` then the app will first try to find items with both genres, and otherwise suggests a mix of both.<br>
> `Exclusions` are seen as hard limits. If a user marks `horror` in red, then no horror will be suggested at all.
- **Suggestion Order:**
  - `Random` (suggestions appear randomly for each user).
  - `Fixed` (everyone gets the same suggestions in the same order).
- **Hard Filter Preferences:** When enabled, preferred selections (green) strictly filter results. When disabled, preferences boost item priority but non-matching items may still appear.
- **Collections:** Enable a collection picker for the host when creating a session. Only items from selected collections will be suggested.
- **Open in Plex Button:** Enables a button on the match winner page to open the item in Plex. Only works by opening Plex in a browser tab.
- **Lobby QR Code:** Display a QR code in the lobby for easy session joining.
- **Rating Display:** Choose whether detail cards show `Critic Rating`, `Audience Rating`or `both`.
- **Label Restrictions:** Include or Exclude items based on Plex labels.
- **PWA Customization:** Customize the PWA name and icon.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting Common Issues:

### ❌ Clients keep waiting on other users/other users are stuck on previous screen:
When you refresh the page, you'll most likely advance. This means your connection doesn't have websocket support.<br>
If you are behind a reverse proxy, you need to enable websocket support. [Nginx Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/211b5cd8-f380-48db-b177-557541feea49)

### ❌ I can't start a session/ "No Media Found":
You first need to build a cache in settings. See step 4 above. Don't forget to click 'Save Settings' after connecting to Plex before refreshing cache.
